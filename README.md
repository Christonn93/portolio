A simple overview of the use/purpose of this project.

## Description

This is my personal portfolio. 

I wanted the design to look like a code editor. So I want to use the code editor I use, which is Visual Studio Code. 

By choosing the look of my code editor the color choices were easy to figure out. I went with the colors on the theme I use in my code editor, some minor adjustments due to contrast but in general it has the look and feel of the code editor and theme I’m currently using. 

At this point in my studies, my knowledge on using Js to display content has been a hot topic, so I decided to use Js to create all the cards and display the information from the cards that way.
